# Con Fusion Server

This is the backend server for a restaurant named _Con Fusion_,
a practice project to learn javascript backend development.

It is written using
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as runtime,
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com) as application framework.
The project structure was generated by
[Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)

It will use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) as the persistent data store (soon).


## Requirements

3.  Start the server
